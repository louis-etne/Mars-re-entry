# Apel remark 

## Atmosphere model : 

what is the product of the square of velocity and density eject the parachute where it is minimum maximum distance in atmosphere w/ parachute wind on Mars do not deploy too early What precision for the landing area wind speeds near ground. 

rotational velocity important
