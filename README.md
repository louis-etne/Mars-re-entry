# Mars Re-entry project

Rules to follow:
- File names must be in `snake_case` except for function names which are in `PascalCase`
- Variables name must represent the data associated and should be annoted with the dimension (if any) and a description
- Don't define constant values in your files, use the `constants.m` file and generate the `constants.mat`.
- Don't import all the constants if you don't need them all, just import what you need
- No other languages than English
- Use git cleverly, don't push tests, only verified and validated code
- As a general rule, **keep everything clean and organized**.
